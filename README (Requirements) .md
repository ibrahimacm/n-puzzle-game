n puzzle game (2 to 16) with 7 algorithms: 
Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Uniform Cost Search, Depth limited Search, Iterative deepening Search, A star Search and Greedy Search.
Requirements:
1-	Implement the n-puzzle problem.
2-	Your tool should accept n as input, along with the initial state. Initial state could be randomly generated as well.
3-	Your tool allows user to select search strategy as input (drop down list)
4-	Solve the problem using the selected search strategy
Produce as output: 
a)	Total number of steps to reach solution (path cost).
b)	Total number of processed nodes until the strategy finds solution.
c)	Maximum number of nodes that have been stored concurrently.
d)	Simulation playback of the solution process showing the transitions from the initial state to the goal state. (time delay should be accepted as input)
